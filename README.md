# Goldman_Sachs-Crack-leaked-password-database
### EXERCISE 
As a governance analyst it is part of your duties to assess the level of protection offered by implemented controls and minimize the probability of a successful breach. You often need to know the techniques used by hackers to circumvent implemented controls and propose uplifts to increase the overall level of security in an organization. Gaining valid credentials gives the attackers access to the organizationâ€™s IT system, thus circumventing most of perimeter controls in place.

### TASK:
Your job is to crack as many passwords as possible with available tools (e.g. use Hashcat). Here are your Task instructions:

Review the links provided in the additional resources (section 4) below to gain a background understanding of password cracking
Try to crack the passwords provided in the 'password dump' file below using available tools
Assess the 5 questions in the task instructions below in relation to the passwords provided (type of hashing algorithm, level of protection, possible controls that could be implemented, password policy, changes in policy)
Draft an email/memo briefly explaining your findings in relation to controls used by the organization and your proposed uplifts. We recommend spending about 1.5 hours on this task and keeping it at 1 page in length. 
Your answer should be provided in the form of a draft email/memo explaining your findings and conclusions of controls currently used by an organization to prevent successful cracking of passwords and potential uplifts that you would propose to existing controls with justifications.

## CONSIDERATIONS:

After analysis, I found that the MD5 algorithm was used to protect the passwords. 

Reading about this algorithm, it is already old (1991) and it is popular cryptographically, so 
I would not use it because it offers very little protection in case of password leakage. 
Should not be used in collision tolerance situations. 

First of all, when assuming passwords, remember that they should be completely different than login. They were different than: 123456, 123456789, qwerty, password, 111111, 12345678, Marcin123, polska. -> these are typical passwords.

Use other password hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2), newer, less popular that are more difficult to crack. Time is an important role of the algorithm. The better we encrypt the password, the longer the time to decrypt it, which is very important, as the required computational work will increase.

Increasing the length of the password, and the use of special characters.

Another point is the password manager that I discovered on my Iphone. There is a system developed there that automatically creates a strong password for us, consisting of many characters.
It is safe.

In my opinion, passwords should have something more when logging in, for example. A good solution is to confirm it via SMS, additional questions are good, for example, to enter a password and face verification.
You have to remember not to overdo verifications, because technology is for people and not for IT specialists.
